A simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The program generates a random number within a specified range, and the user has to guess the correct number through a series of attempts, with the program providing feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.

This project is designed to be a beginner-friendly introduction to programming concepts such as random number generation, conditional statements, and input/output handling. It can be used as a learning resource for those new to programming or as a starting point for more advanced projects.

Features:
- Configurable range for the random number
- Keeps track of the number of guesses it took the user to reach the correct answer
- Provides clear feedback on each guess
- Simple and easy-to-understand codebase
